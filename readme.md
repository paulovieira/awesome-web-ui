## Scroll

- [utatti/perfect-scrollbar](https://github.com/utatti/perfect-scrollbar) - Minimalistic but perfect custom scrollbar plugin: no change on design layout; no manipulation on DOM tree; use plain scrollTop and scrollLeft; scrollbar style is fully customizable; efficient update on layout change.
- [Grsmto/simplebar](https://github.com/Grsmto/simplebar) - Custom scrollbars vanilla javascript library with native scroll. Lightweight, easy to use and cross-browser. Does NOT implement a custom scroll behaviour. It keeps the native overflow: auto scroll and only replace the scrollbar visual appearance.
- [KingSora/OverlayScrollbars](https://github.com/KingSora/OverlayScrollbars) - js scrollbar plugin which hides the native scrollbars and provides custom styleable overlay scrollbars, but keeps the native functionality and feeling. Textarea and Body support.



## Modal dialog

- [robinparisi/tingle](https://github.com/robinparisi/tingle) - minimalist and easy-to-use modal plugin written in pure js
- [anseki/plain-modal](https://github.com/anseki/plain-modal) - fully customizable modal window; has basic functions only, and it does nothing about visual style of the modal window;
